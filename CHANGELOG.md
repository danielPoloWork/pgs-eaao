# Changelog

All notable changes to `pgs-eados` (EADOS) are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Every PR that introduces a user- or maintainer-visible change adds a line to `[Unreleased]`
in the same PR. Releases follow Semantic Versioning; the latest is **v1.2.1**.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **ADR-0011 — phase-based delivery operating system.** Records the owner-confirmed direction to
  evolve the factory into EADOS: an opt-in phase pipeline (`init → design → plan → scaffold →
  audit → refactor`) over the unchanged data-driven core, resident as a capability under each
  generated repo's own `AGENTS.md`. The detailed design lands in RFC-0001.
- **RFC-0001 + the machine-readable OS specs (the design package).** The full design for the
  delivery-OS pivot: [`docs/rfc/0001-eados-delivery-os.md`](.eados-core/docs/rfc/0001-eados-delivery-os.md)
  (phase state machine, role/authority model, ownership map, traceability graph, the enterprise
  lens, and the roadmap M1–M5), plus the three **schema-first** specs under
  `orchestrator/os/{workflow,authority,git}/` (each `_schema.md` + reference instance), validated
  by a new `os-spec-completeness` gate in `eados_lint.py`. Diagrams are Mermaid (code) under
  `docs/rfc/assets/`. No runtime behavior changes yet — this is design only; build starts at M1.

### Changed

- **BREAKING — the project is renamed EAAO → EADOS** (*Enterprise Agentic Architecture
  Orchestrator* → **Enterprise Agentic Delivery Operating System**; ADR-0012). The factory folder
  `.eaao-core/` is now `.eados-core/`, the self-lint is `tools/eados_lint.py`, the dev sentinel is
  `.eados-dev`, and the distribution bundle is `pgs-eados-bundle.*`. Consumers who vendored the
  bundle must update their `.eados-core/` path and re-download from the new asset name. The GitHub
  repository is renamed `pgs-eaao` → `pgs-eados` (old URLs auto-redirect). Under SemVer this is a
  breaking, consumer-visible change — the next release should bump accordingly.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Generated projects carry their own owner, not EADOS's.** The renderer copied EADOS's root
  `LICENSE` verbatim into every generated repo (`Copyright (c) 2026 Daniel Polo`) even though the
  README rendered the maintainer's `{{AUTHOR}}`. A new `templates/LICENSE.tmpl`
  (`Copyright (c) {{YEAR}} {{AUTHOR}}`) is rendered into the generated `LICENSE` instead; EADOS's
  own `LICENSE` is untouched. The interview no longer defaults the reverse-domain group path to
  the reference's `it/d4np` — it asks the maintainer's own.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **In-place generation** — `render.py --in-place` writes the generated project into the folder
  that holds `.eados-core/` (the bundle copied into your own repo, `<repo>/.eados-core/`), so the
  project files land in `<repo>/` next to it. The rendered `.gitignore` excludes `.eados-core/`,
  and a root `.eados-dev` sentinel keeps the factory's own dev repo safe; `--out <dir>` still
  renders a separate copy.
- **Full roadmap up front** — the interview now elicits *all* milestones at generation, and
  `ROADMAP.md` + the README milestone table render every one. New `spec.milestones`
  (`number`/`title`/`goal`/`items`) plus a nested `{{#ITEMS}}` loop in the renderer.
- **Releases auto-attach the factory bundle** — a `release.yml` workflow uploads the version-less
  `pgs-eados-bundle.tar.gz` / `.zip` on every published release.

### Changed

- **The distribution bundle is prefix-less** — `git archive` no longer wraps the bundle in a
  `pgs-eados/` folder, so extracting it at the root of your project repo drops `.eados-core/` there
  directly (not in a subfolder).
- README getting-started reworked consumer-first (download the bundle, no clone), and the
  copy-paste commands fixed to their `.eados-core/` paths.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Distribution bundle** — a `.gitattributes` `export-ignore` ruleset so `git archive` emits a
  clean, factory-only consumer bundle (the factory + the `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md`
  contract + `LICENSE`), stripping this repository's own governance and plumbing. Adds an
  `.eados-core/README.md` entry-point how-to and a "Distribution bundle" section in
  `.eados-core/docs/USAGE.md`.

### Changed

- Consolidated all factory machinery under `.eados-core/`: the documentation i18n set moved from
  the repo-root `docs/i18n/` to `.eados-core/docs/i18n/`, with the `i18n-freshness` gate and every
  reference updated to match.
- `AGENTS.md`'s links to EADOS's own `CONTRIBUTING.md` and CI workflow are now absolute (canonical
  repo URLs) so they resolve from a distributed bundle.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-19

First public release. EADOS is a language-agnostic factory that interviews a maintainer,
records the answers in a single manifest, and renders a fully governed, enterprise-grade
repository from parameterized templates — for any of 19 language toolchains.

### Added

- **The factory** — the interview → resolve-profile → manifest → render → verify pipeline:
  a deterministic Mustache-subset renderer (`render.py`), a factory self-lint (`eados_lint.py`),
  19 seed language profiles, the parameterized enterprise templates, and the agent-runnable
  consistency lint shipped into every generated repository. Decisions recorded as ADRs
  (0001–0010).
- Self-governance artifacts so the factory meets the bar it imposes downstream:
  `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability policy + private reporting), `CHANGELOG.md`, a
  `.github/` pull-request template, issue forms (`bug_report`, `feature_request`, `config`),
  and `CODEOWNERS`.
- README status badges (CI, MIT, Python 3.12+, 19 language profiles, Conventional Commits).
- Documentation i18n: full `zh-Hans` + `ja` README translations under `docs/i18n/`, a
  `translation-status.md` freshness manifest, a glossary, and an enforced `i18n-freshness`
  check in `eados_lint.py`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the owner-governed contribution model in `AGENTS.md` §6:
  contributors suggest via PRs, the owner decides and squash-merges, `main` is protected.
- ADR-0010 — content-hash i18n freshness (squash-merge-proof).
- `.portfolio.json` — pinned title/tags/order + trilingual description for the portfolio card.

### Changed

- Repository merge policy set to **squash-only** (merge-commit and rebase disabled), with
  delete-branch-on-merge.
- `i18n-freshness` pins translations to the English source's **SHA-256 content hash** instead
  of a commit SHA, and no longer needs git history (`fetch-depth: 0` dropped from CI).

### Fixed

- `i18n-freshness` no longer falsely reports translations stale after a squash-merge orphans
  the recorded source commit (it broke `main` CI right after the squash-only policy landed) —
  see ADR-0010.
